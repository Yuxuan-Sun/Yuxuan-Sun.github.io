Hello! My name is Yuxuan Sun. I'm currently (2023) a first year PhD student at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. Before that, I received a B.S. degree with double majors in Computer Science and Mathematics at Haverford College. My undergrad math thesis advisor is [Elizabeth Milićević](https://www.haverford.edu/users/emilicevic) and CS is [Sara Mathieson](https://smathieson.sites.haverford.edu).

For now, my mathematical research interests mainly lie in algebraic combinatorics and representation theory. On the side I also have some interests in automated theorem proving. On my free time, I enjoy cooking and bouldering.
